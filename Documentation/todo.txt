== Designing

* Have a "gameLossType" variable in GameState, as a player can also lose the game when their deck is empty in the draw phase.

== Coding

* Make command parsing handle optional parameters
	eg summon h2 1
		     ^
  (Currently num given parameters = mapped parameters, ie either complete match or not match)
